1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
 We've heard from the French president saying that Israel must stop killing babies and women in Gaza.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.700
 Emmanuel Macron told the BBC in an exclusive interview at the Elysee Palace

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.800
 that there was no justification for the bombing, saying that a ceasefire would benefit Israel.

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.100
 While recognising Israel's right to protect itself, he said,

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 we do urge them to stop this bombing in Gaza.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.600
 He's been speaking to the BBC's Europe editor, Katia Adler.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.199
 We've had weeks of aid organisations sounding the alarm about Gaza,

8
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.200
 and so you've now said that humanitarian pauses in fighting aren't enough

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.700
 and there needs to be work towards a ceasefire.

10
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.200
 Are you disappointed that other world leaders aren't joining you in that call, like the US or the UK?

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.100
 No, I hope they will.

12
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.000
 And let's be clear, I mean, I was one of the first leaders to call the Prime Minister

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 and President of Israel after the terrorist attack on the 7th of October.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.600
 We clearly condemned the terrorist attack and terrorist group

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.000
 and recognise the right of Israel to protect itself and react.

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 But day one, we say that this reaction and the fight against terrorism,

17
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.700
 because it is led by a democracy, should be compliant with international rules,

18
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.200
 rule of war and humanitarian international law.

19
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.200
 And day after day, what we saw is a permanent bombing of civilians in Gaza.

20
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.000
 And I think it's very important to say the whole story,

21
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.200
 but I think this is the only solution we have.

22
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.100
 This is fire. Because it's impossible to explain.

23
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.800
 We want to fight against terrorism by killing innocent people.

24
00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.200
 You've talked about the fight against terrorism needing to be merciless,

25
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.000
 is the word you used, but not without rules.

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.799
 And you've just referred there to the high loss of civilian life in Gaza.

27
00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.099
 Do you think Israel is respecting those rules, the international rules that you're referring to?

28
00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:16.000
 Look, in the very first days, it's clear that the emotion, the compassion,

29
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.800
 created a situation where everybody was just close to Israel

30
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.800
 and backing them and sharing the pain.

31
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.199
 And we do share their pain and we do share their willingness to get rid of terrorism.

32
00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:36.199
 We know what terrorism means in France.

33
00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:42.800
 But I think there is no justification precisely to attack civilians.

34
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.200
 What I would like just to clarify with you,

35
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.200
 are you saying that Israel is guilty of breaking international humanitarian law, potential war crimes?

36
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.600
 No, I'm here, look, I think it's not the proper way to approach the question.

37
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.000
 We do recognise their right to protect themselves.

38
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.600
 And one month after the terrorist attack,

39
00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:12.599
 I think it would be not the right way to deal with a partner, a friend,

40
00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.000
 just to say you will be condemned and you are guilty.

41
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.799
 De facto, today, civilians are bombed.

42
00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:26.599
 De facto. These babies, these ladies, these old people are bombed and killed.

43
00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.199
 There is no reason for that and no legitimacy.

44
00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.400
 So we do urge Israel to stop.

45
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.200
 I'm not here to... I'm not a judge. I'm a head of state.

46
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.000
 I just remind everybody international law.

47
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.200
 I call for a ceasefire and I will urge them for a ceasefire, for a humanitarian ceasefire.

48
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.599
 That was Emmanuel Macron.

49
00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.000
 Well, let's bring in our panel.

50
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.200
 Andrew Fisher, former Director of Policy at the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn,

51
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.800
 and Mo Elasi, Executive Director at the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service.

52
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.600
 Interested for you both for your reactions there to what Emmanuel Macron had to say.

53
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600
 Andrew, I'll start with you.

54
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.600
 Yeah, look, I think it's very welcome that he's joined the majority of world leaders,

55
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.800
 we shouldn't forget, who are calling now for a ceasefire in this conflict.

56
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.400
 And it leaves President Biden and Rishi Sunak in the UK increasingly isolated in not backing a ceasefire.

57
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.000
 We saw the UN, you know, over 120 countries backed a ceasefire.

58
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.800
 Only a few, I think 14, voted against the US, one of them.

59
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.399
 So this is really important and a significant shift.

60
00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:39.800
 And look, Emmanuel Macron is obviously a diplomat, a head of state.

61
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.399
 But the fact that he's saying to Israel, you have to abide by international law,

62
00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:46.000
 is a clear recognition that currently they're not.

63
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 We've seen white phosphorus being used in densely populated areas.

64
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.399
 We've seen the carpet bombing of civilian areas.

65
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.600
 You know, we've seen a siege imposed on a civilian population,

66
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.200
 all of which are illegal under international law.

67
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.000
 It's very clear that Israel has not acted within international law

68
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.600
 in this reaction to the terrible events of the 7th of October.

69
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.000
 So it's a significant intervention from Emmanuel Macron.

70
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.800
 And I hope it has influence both in the UK and in the US,

71
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.800
 because at the end of the day, there is no military solution to this.

72
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.200
 It is going to require a ceasefire and talks and a peaceful settlement

73
00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:28.800
 that the Palestinians and the Israelis have been let down by their leaders

74
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.000
 and by the international community for at least 30 years

75
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.800
 since the last big, serious attempt to try and get there.

76
00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:38.199
 Mo, with regards to the kind of international community,

77
00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.199
 do you think other leaders will look at what Emmanuel Macron had to say,

78
00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.199
 take on board those comments and start to think they might air theirs more strongly?

79
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.800
 Perhaps. I think a lot of the world is still...

80
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.400
 A lot of the world is really torn.

81
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.000
 They want to see Israel exercise its right to self-defense.

82
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.400
 They know that Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization

83
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.600
 and that it itself is acting against the best interests

84
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.000
 of the people they purport to represent.

85
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.400
 Hamas itself is working against the best interests of the Palestinian people,

86
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.800
 preventing many of them from leaving, using them as a tool

87
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.600
 using them as human shields.

88
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.199
 And so, you know, I think a lot of the world is still trying to grapple with this.

89
00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:32.000
 I think people are increasingly horrified by the scenes and the images we are seeing

90
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.800
 of the devastation in Gaza and of all of the people who died

91
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.600
 as a result of the military action.

92
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.199
 I found it interesting that the Israeli ambassador to the UN

93
00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:52.599
 used the opportunity to attack the UN for accepting Hamas's propaganda.

94
00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:58.800
 Some of it is propaganda, and I'd take anything Hamas does with a grain of salt.

95
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.199
 But at the same time, we are seeing these images for ourselves.

96
00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:05.199
 We are seeing the devastation for ourselves.

97
00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:09.800
 We know whatever the number is, too many civilians are being killed.

98
00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:16.800
 I'm happy to see that there's now going to be a daily humanitarian pause.

99
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.400
 Israel seemed to be forced to take that step by international pressure.

100
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.199
 The Biden administration has been very aggressive in pushing that.

101
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.400
 But they do need to take more steps in their legitimate effort to eradicate Hamas

102
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.199
 to protect the civilians, and I'm not sure they're doing that well right now.

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
 Well, as I mentioned, we've also been taking a closer look at the evacuation corridor south

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.599
 from the northern tip of Gaza, which has been opened once again today. And our reporter

3
00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.359
 Merlyn Thomas from BBC Verify has been looking at that corridor and what the journey south

4
00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.160
 entails.

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.960
 Israel has been ordering civilians in northern Gaza to move south for their safety as they

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.920
 continue their offensive in the north. But what does that mean for civilians of Gaza?

7
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.320
 Well, the Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated areas on earth. There are over a

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.960
 million people living in the northern part before this conflict started. And the Israeli

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.120
 military have been telling people to move south using this specific road, Salah ad-Din.

10
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.120
 It's one of the two main arteries connecting the north to the south. And we've seen some

11
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.600
 of them, some of these people, moving south. As you can see, some of them are carrying

12
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.280
 white flags, children, men, women, carrying with them all the possessions that they have.

13
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.799
 Now, this footage was filmed by the AFP news agency on Monday. They spoke to one of those

14
00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.519
 Gazans on the road about her experience.

15
00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:08.239
 It was so scary. We saw tanks from both sides. We didn't see soldiers, just tanks. We held

16
00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:14.439
 our hands up and we kept walking. There were so many of us. We were holding white flags.

17
00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.319
 It's true that we were scared, but finally we made it through.

18
00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:24.280
 So how has the Israeli military been telling them? These are some of those pictures of

19
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.120
 the mass drops of leaflets. Now, these white specks you can see here are those leaflets

20
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.200
 dropping down from the Israeli military onto the ground. And they had messages urging locals

21
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.320
 to move to the south for their own safety.

22
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.040
 Now, they've also been posting messages on X. For example, this one. Today, the Israeli

23
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.560
 military posted in Arabic that the main road here for evacuation, the one we've just been

24
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.040
 talking about, would be open between 10 in the morning and 4 in the afternoon local time.

25
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.760
 Yesterday, the Israeli military posted a video on X showing the civilians walking on Salahuddin

26
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.160
 Road. Now, we've just paused this video here so you can see an Israeli tank in the foreground.

27
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.200
 We've managed to verify this using the shape of the buildings and the road composition

28
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.759
 as approximately three kilometres north of worthy Gaza, what the Israelis consider to

29
00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.120
 be the boundary between the north and south of Gaza.

30
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.439
 We've also found this satellite imagery taken yesterday showing some of the stretch of the

31
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.960
 road. And if you look closely, you can see here the outlines of people on the road moving

32
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.520
 down the road down south. But if you look elsewhere in the image, you can also see the

33
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.000
 damage to the buildings and the rubble and the debris that spilled out onto the road.

34
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 And this is what those people will have had to cross. And finally, if you look here, you

35
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.319
 can actually spot an Israeli tank here too, right next to the road, which these people

36
00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.199
 will have had to walk past.

37
00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:52.159
 We've also been analysing satellite imagery captured on the 31st of October and the 3rd

38
00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.799
 of November. And using both of these, we've been able to assess the amount of damage on

39
00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.119
 the road and the buildings alongside it. So every single dot here, every single red dot

40
00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:05.679
 here represents damage of some kind to the road, whether that's craters on the road,

41
00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:10.359
 to the tarmac of the road or buildings damaged close to the road. We can't tell exactly when

42
00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.879
 this damage occurred, but let's take a closer look at these two areas here.

43
00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.919
 This one here, you can see a crater on the main road itself. This is what people will

44
00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:25.879
 have had to pass. And this, here you can see some buildings here in the middle destroyed

45
00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:31.479
 and the debris that scattered onto the road that people again will have had to cross.

46
00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.919
 Now we don't know how many people have used this road to move to safety. The UN suggested

47
00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.719
 that thousands have moved on one single day. But the question remains, as the fighting

48
00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:45.759
 continues in the north, how many more desperate people will have to make this choice?

49
00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:54.079
 Merlin Thomas from BBC Verify looking at that evacuation south. And the UN has estimated

50
00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.879
 that one and a half million people in Gaza are now displaced. Well, a little earlier,

51
00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.199
 I spoke to our colleague Rushdie Abualuf, our correspondent inside Gaza. He's in the

52
00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:09.000
 southern part of Gaza in Khan Yunis. And I asked him whether he had seen evidence of

53
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.840
 more people moving south today.

54
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.279
 The father who's carrying his son over his shoulder in the heat of the sun, it's unusual

55
00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:51.759
 weather here in Gaza. In November, it's really about 30 degrees in Gaza. But yes, people

56
00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.800
 under the sun were walking, carrying their kids, some of their belongings if they can.

57
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.279
 And they made this journey into south. Why? Because the fighting in Gaza City is really

58
00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:09.679
 intensified. Taking very serious fight near the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza. It's a Tell

59
00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:15.079
 el-Hawa area. It's a neighbourhood in the south-west of Gaza. As the tanks advance very

60
00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:21.000
 close to the hospital and people there, very few people remain in the area. And communication

61
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.719
 is really hard. But I was talking to someone who fled this morning, and he said it was

62
00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:31.000
 a real gun battle in the area. Most of the buildings around that neighbourhood, from

63
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:38.040
 the beginning of the Israeli attack on Gaza following the Hamas cross-border attack, this

64
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.680
 area was heavily bombed from air for days. And now it's been bombed from sea and from

65
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.680
 artillery units in the ground. The picture that I saw, it's really showing hundreds of

66
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.680
 targets has been destroyed in this building. This area is considered most of the wealthy

67
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.199
 people that live here. It's quite a new area that was built 25 years ago. Most of the buildings

68
00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:11.439
 are seven-storey buildings, like compound in the area. Most of the buildings were hit.

69
00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:16.800
 Either completely flattened to the ground or hit some of the great damage to some of

70
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.800
 the buildings. The fighting also intensified near beach camp. Beach camp is the only refugee

71
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.120
 camp in Gaza City with about 60,000, 70,000 people live in that camp. Most of them were

72
00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:34.639
 left, but people were still there and people were, many bodies are under their houses,

73
00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:41.639
 according to health ministry here. Fighting in that direction is north, west of Gaza.

74
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.800
 It's all around the coastal road where all of the fighting is going on. But also, the

75
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.000
 tanks are advancing from another position, which is south of the city. So now most of

76
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.959
 the tanks are surrounding significant part of the Gaza City and they are advancing hard

77
00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:06.399
 into the Al-Quds Hospital, where about 14,000 people are taking the hospital as shelter,

78
00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:11.759
 as well as 100 patients. Yesterday, the hospital said that they can't move people, they can't

79
00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.600
 move patients from the hospital because there is no road around it, it's not damaged.
